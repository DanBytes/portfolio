                        For most of my work life I have worked for Australian retail giant Woolworths. What I learned
                        from working in retail is
                        that the <em>right attitude is everything</em>.

                        <li>Genuine passion for food & shopping</li>
                        <li>Customer first mentality</li>
                        <li>Love of teamwork and growing with others</li>
                        <li>Flexible and adaptable to chang</li>
                        <li>Willing to work and reliable</li>

                    <p>Currently I am enrolled in Coder Academy bootcamp.
                        Which is a 6-month course that would make me job ready fullstack
                        developer. The reason why I joined this course is to get some
                        guidance from the awesome mentors and make a carrer
                        change. Technology (software development) is something that
                        I always had intrest in and I have been trying to learn on
                        and off by my self. So far it has been challanging and rewarding.
                        Everyday I am learning something new.

                <p>I am very new to the tech scene and there are so may opportunities to grow and learn.
                    I have a small(ish) list of things that I’d like tolearn and experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn how to communicate better.<br>
                        (English is not my first lanuage. Russian and Dutch are other languages that I speak.)</li>
                    <li>Building better connection with other people. <br>
                        (I am an extraverted person but I really really want to change that. I would like to be able to
                        connect with other
                        people better. This is a hard task for me but not imposible.)</li>
                    <li>Being effective in javascript. <br>
                        (I find javascript awesome language, I am just not good at it yet.)</li>
                    <li>Getting back in shape with fitness. <br>
                        (Lately I havent been exerceising as much as I used to. I am gonna try to embed fitness into
                        life again.)</li>
