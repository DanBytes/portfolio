## Part A

### Purpose
The purpose of my portfolio website is to introduce myself to the world and potential employers.

### Functionality and Features
My portfolio has 4 main sections that inform the visitor about me.
- About Me (Some general information about me.)
- Skills (Showing coding languages I'm comfortable with so far.)
- Connect (Ways to get in touch with me, links to my Linkedin, Github, Twitter profile.)
- Goals (Future plans,)


I have 5 main (I find) cool elements incorporated into my portfolio:
- The globe has a spinning effect and lots of box-shadows to make it look more organic.
- Navigation bar is fixed fo that the user never loses it when scrolling.
- Each section has a different background to destinguish itself from others.
- The backgrounds are sort of paralax.
- When user interacts with the navigation bar it will scroll them to the desired section,

### Target Audience
Industry recruiters, software companies.

### Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS

### Design Planning
In the brain storming phase I was thinking for the themes for the site. I also wanted to create a
clean and colourful pixel art porfolio that displays my personality and creativity.
The themes are "dicovery"  and "introduction" as indicated by opening title "hello world"  and a spinning globe.
### Initial Wireframes
Those designs were dropped due to the complexity.

### New Wireframes
Much easier design

#### Mood Board Inspiration
![Mobile goals](docs/moodboard.png)
#### Initial Idea
Initially I had an idea to have a rocket ship as a fixed navigation menu to the side. The ship is "landing" or "ascending" on the web page as the 
user is crolling. However I had to scrap that idea because I coulndt make the rocket s 
I could not make the ship look desent and I figured out that it would be a tough work in long run.

#### Accessibility
This is would be revised in future iteration of the site. Color Oracle seems like an exellent software to test colours for blind people.

### Technologies Used
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub
- Ubuntu Terminal
- Adobe Color CC
- Canva
- Moodzer
- Firefox Developer Tools

### Bugs
- The intro screen is broken on mobile devices in landscape mode. (Will try to fix that in next iteration)

### Future updates.
- Accesability for color blind people.
- Fix alighnment of the content in portrait modes.
- Improve content on the site.
- Instead of using "scroll-behavior: smooth;" in css (which isn't compatible with many browsers) use javascript for 
    smooth scrolling to reach greater comatiblity.
##Part B
### 1.Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today.
TImeline:

1981 - The TCP/IP standards were published and adapted.
1983, TCP/IP protocols became the only approved protocol on the ARPANET (The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). This was the first form of internet used by scientists.
1989 - The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
1990 - ARPANET was starting to show the age and the project was closed down.
1991 -  World Wide Web become accessible to anyone with internet connection.
1992 - The first ever browser was created with GUI named Erwise.
1992 - Dial Up was first commercially offered by Sprint.
1994 - Netscape navigator was created and it was the most popular browser then.
1998 - Google was created.
2004 - Facebook was created.
2005 - YouTube was invented.
 

### 2.Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers.

#### Domain. (Identifier)
Domain is a unique identifier for IP address. Instead of writing I.P address (e.g 193.212.204.123) we use memorable words instead (e.g google.com). Domain acts much like a phone number.

#### DNS (Matching System)
Domain Name System (DNS) - in a nutshell, it is a client-server communication system. Clients on the network send requests and they receive the responses. Think of it as a phone book that matches phone numbers (domains) to services on receiving end .

#### Web Servers (Matched service with the client)
Web servers are programs that deliver content to the end user over the internet.

#### Web Browsers (Clients)
Browsers are basically clients (end users) on the network. They request data from the web servers and interpret the requests on users machines.  

### 3.Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today

While I was researching the information it came to my attention that the internet advanced rapidly and still is. Especially in the 90â€™s when it became publicly available, it became part of our lives nowadays, even an necessity. Many useful services live on the internet.
